	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ChaosLordFlavor" value="A Chaos Lord is a tyrannical warrior king who lives to bathe in the blood of worlds. He strives to bring whole star systems to their knees in the name of his patron deities.

	<entry name="Tau/CadreFirebladeFlavor" value="As the enemy surges closer, the Fireblade's courage steels his comrades, steadying the firing line and focussing the mind of every Fire Warrior present. Raising his pulse rifle and sighting down its length, the Cadre Fireblade calls out enemy weak spots and optimal firing solutions to his followers, watching the foe press closer with a practised eye. Only at the optimum moment does the Fireblade bark out the order to fire. At the Fireblade's command, the T'au gunline unleashes a storm of fire, an energised squall that tears the enemy to pieces with terrible efficiency."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/AutarchFlavor" value="Autarchs have a consummate understanding of the way of the warrior, and the future of the race has been shaped by their excellence in the arts of death. They follow the Path of Command, gaining a wider appreciation of battle than any other and directing the warhost on the most efficient path to victory. Theirs is a burning obsession to see war itself conquered and made subservient to their will."/>
